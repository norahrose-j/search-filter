                    <p>You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p><br>
                    <p>Three times per long rest you can use this sword as though you had cast 'Command' at 
                        3rd level. Charisma is your ability for this spell.</p><br>
                    <p>Proficiency with a Greatsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack 
                        roll for any attack you make with it.</p>

                    <p>This weapon has the following mastery property. To use this property, you must have a 
                        feature that lets you use it.</p><br>
                    <p><span class = "bold">Graze.  </span>  If your attack roll with this weapon misses a creature, 
                        you can deal damage to that creature equal to the ability modifier you used to make the 
                        attack roll. This damage is the same type dealt by the weapon, and the damage can be 
                        increased only by increasing the ability modifier.</p>
